# About This Game

You're a small-time drug dealer rolling into a fresh town with no cash, no product and no connections. Build your drug empire from the ground up in the grungy west-coast city of Hyland Point. Contend against intensifying law enforcement and deadly cartel competitors to expand your empire and reach the peak of the underworld.

* Produce a range of drugs to satisfy your customers, each one with it's own unique production process. Discover special recipes to create new drug variants with special properties.
* Walk, skate or drive throughout Hyland Point to get product into the hands of customers. Hire dealers to handle distribution for you.
* Purchase new properties and hire employees to expand the scope and scale of your operations. Work with suppliers to build a fully automated production and distribution chain.
* This is a dangerous line of work - you'll have to contend with increasing law enforcement, as well as deadly cartel competitors. Fight with fists, melee weapons or firearms.
* A growing empire needs skilled management. Reach new heights in co-op multiplayer.
